      <h1>Brooklyn Bridge Bike Lane</h1>

  <p> According to the New York City Department of Transportation’s bicycle counts, the Brooklyn Bridge sees less bicycle traffic than any other East River bridge. Thanks to the brand new Brooklyn Bridge two-way protected bike lane, that is likely to change. However, less than a month since the lane’s opening, planners and activists are advocating for improvements. Below are four major factors affecting the safety and efficiency of the lanes.

      <div class="text"><strong>BARRIERS:</strong> The bridge’s lanes are flanked on either side: one side is protected with cement barriers and the other with a wall and chain-link fence to separate it from cars.  Whether or not a bike lane is protected can make a big difference in determining the lane’s relative safety. According to a 2014 New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) report, the installment of protected bike lanes in Manhattan led to major decreases in crashes and cyclist injuries over a seven year period. The city installed over 28 miles of protected lanes in 2020, meaning the city now has a total of 545 miles of protected lanes. </div>



      <div class="icon">
        <img src="images/Width.png" alt="arrows pointing in opposite directions"></div>
      <div class="text"><strong>WIDTH:</strong> The main complaint is that the Brooklyn Bridge bike lane is not wide enough. It only meets the minimum two-way bike lane width requirement of 8 feet, making passing very difficult. According to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, two-bike lanes are most effective when they are 12 feet wide. Without a shoulder, there is no space for cyclists to pull off in case of an emergency. Bridges4People, a Transportation Alternatives campaign, is already advocating for the lane to be widened by removing another car lane from the bridge.

      <div class="icon">
        <img src="images/Speed.png" alt="a speedometer"></div>
      <div class="text"><strong>SPEED:</strong> According to DOT, Class 1, 2 and 3 E-bikes are allowed to ride in bike lanes. A Class 3 road bike can go up to 25 miles per hour, a much faster speed than a cyclist can move on a non-electric bicycle. As a result, speed differences on bike lanes can introduce safety hazards for both cyclists and e-cyclists. Currently, electric modes of transit, including e-bikes and e-scooters share the Brooklyn bridge bike lane with regular cyclists. </div>

      <div class="icon">
      <img src="images/Surface.png" alt="uneven surface street sign"></div>
      <div class="text"><strong>SURFACE:</strong> A smooth, freshly paved surface makes for ideal cycling and safety conditions. Unfortunately, the new surface is not as smooth as some might have expected. Kathleen Willis, campaign head of Bridges4People said she encountered an uneven surface that required her to swerve during her first traverse of the bridge. A Federal Highway Administration course guide on bicycle and pedestrian transportation clearly states that a bicycle lane surface should be smooth and free of obstacles. It should also be clearly paved and maintained regularly.
